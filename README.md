General Description on the Project:
>The following project is on a game called Scrabble by using different data structures.
The data structures which have been used for making this game are Linked List, Stacks, Queues, Arrays, and Tries. There is a library which contains the inventory 
of all those words which are appectable in our game and for that we have a words.txt file. Now, this txt file have been stored in our Tries. Queue data structure 
have been used to mange the inventory of the player, when the user enters the word it gets stored in a Queue and after checking the existance of the word, it gets 
stored in another Trie, which basically have the completed words on a board. Two arrays have been used one contains the points or scores against the alphabets and 
the other stores the invntory of scrabble. A 2D array have also been used to make the scrabble board. Lastly a Linked Lists maintains the user turns and the 
sequence of Playing.
